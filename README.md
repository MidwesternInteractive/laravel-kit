## Local Environment
If you haven't already, make sure you have your local environment setup.

[Local Environment Setup](https://github.com/MidwesternInteractive/local-environment)

# Set Up
__*Note*__ `$` represents a terminal command and should not be typed out.

All commands (unless otherwise specified) should be ran from home dir:
```shell
$ cd
```

## Laravel Installer
```shell
$ composer global require laravel/installer
```

## Install Laravel Project
```shell
$ cd ~/projects/
$ laravel new project-name
```
__*Note*__ to change `/projects/` to your project directory if different.

Use the name of the repository as the project name (replacing spaces and special characters), keep in mind that if your using `valet park` instead of `valet link` the project name will become a directory and default your local domain to "project-name.dev".

## Require composer dependencies
```shell
$ cd project-name
$ composer require mwi/laravel-kit
```


## JavaScript Packages
These packages are on an as need basis. If a theme was incorporated they may not be necessary.
